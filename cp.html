            Competitive programming is my thing! It's not just a hobby; it's like a fun challenge where I get to solve problems using code. Whether it's tackling puzzles or coding contests, it's a cool way to exercise my brain and have a good time.</p>
        <p class="headd">    
            What makes it even better is the friendly competition. I get to connect with other coding enthusiasts, share ideas, and learn new tricks. It's not just about winning; it's about the excitement of solving problems and getting better at coding.</p>
            <p class="headd"> I have started coding here in college both frontend and backend. Since then my interest lies there. My current codeforces rating is 1200, which is satisfactory as of now.</p>
