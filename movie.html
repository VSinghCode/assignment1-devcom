        <p class="headd"> Watching movies and web shows is my go-to thing for having a good time! It's not just a hobby; it's like going on a little adventure without leaving my couch. Whether it's a movie night with friends or a solo binge-watch session, it's my way of relaxing and having fun.</p>
        <p class="headd">My favourite genres are science fiction and thriller(crime-thriller would be prefered:). <br> Current favourite movie- Shutter Island <br> Current favourite web series- Peaky Blinders.<br>
        <br>"My coding journey is like a trip to Shutter Island. There are twists, turns, and occasionally, I question if the bugs are just playing mind games with me."</p>
