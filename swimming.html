            I love swimming ‚Äì it's not just a hobby, but also a way for me to relax and have fun with friends. When I glide through the water,
             it feels peaceful and helps me forget about everyday worries. Besides keeping me fit, swimming lets me make new friends who enjoy it too.
             Each time I swim, it's like a calming exercise that makes me feel happy and refreshed.

            <p class="headd">I embarked on my swimming journey from my hometown in 2016, now with an experience of 7 years.Continuing this legacy, I am a part of swimming in NSO here at IITB.

            My secret talent? I debug code underwater, where the only syntax errors are the bubbles I create. It's the ultimate aquatic debugging experience! üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª
